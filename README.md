# 🏛️ PointCloudProject

**3D_PointCloudProject** is a deep-learning-based system designed to generate accurate 3D models from 2D image sequences. The project focuses on **cultural heritage conservation**, providing a digital pipeline to preserve monuments and artifacts using modern computer vision techniques.

By integrating **Structure-from-Motion (SfM)**, **Multi-View Stereo (MVS)**, **point cloud vectorization**, and **mask-based segmentation**, the system creates high-fidelity 3D meshes suitable for virtual documentation, restoration, and visualization.

## 🌟 Objectives

* **Develop** a modular 3D reconstruction pipeline from 2D imagery
* **Implement** segmentation-based masking to remove occlusions (e.g., humans, birds)
* **Integrate** advanced reconstruction algorithms (BPA, Poisson)
* **Evaluate** system performance using real and open datasets

## 🧪 Methodology

### 1. Image Acquisition

Captured from multiple angles (≈70% overlap) using:

| Device    | Focal Length | Resolution |
| :-------- | :----------- | :--------- |
| iPhone 12 | 13mm         | 3024×4032  |
| Sony a7IV | 35mm         | 7008×4672  |

### 2. Sparse Point Cloud Generation

* Used **COLMAP** for feature extraction, camera pose estimation, and bundle adjustment
* Generated accurate 3D point clouds from multiple viewpoints

### 3. Masking & Segmentation

* Applied **DeepLabV3 (Xception backbone)** trained on **ADE20K** dataset
* Segmented out dynamic occluders (humans, birds, etc.)

### 4. Point Cloud Vectorization

Two reconstruction algorithms used:

#### 🌀 Ball-Pivoting Algorithm (BPA)

* Rolls a virtual ball across the surface points to generate a triangular mesh
* Effective for well-sampled, clean data

#### 🧱 Poisson Reconstruction

* Implicit surface fitting method producing smooth, watertight meshes
* Controlled by parameters like tree depth, scale, and linear fitting

### 5. Visualization

Meshes exported as `.ply` files and visualized using:

* **Open3D** for rendering and analysis
* **Three.js** for web-based visualization
* **LOD generation** for scalable rendering performance
